# Where is the best coffee in the world?

I tried to answer this question using a dataset from the [Coffee Quality Database](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database) that I downloaded from [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md)'s GitHub.

The data needed to be cleaned up and I did an extensive data cleanup using the <code>pandas</code> library in Python. The code can be found in the __Jupyter Notebook__ "Coffee Ratings Cleanup.ipynb". I also uploaded the original dataset as well as the one I cleaned up. Lastly, I created a __Tableau__ dashboard that you can explore [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/diego.caballero.loza#!/vizhome/data-visualizations/CoffeeDashboard).

The following are the environment, library, and Python versions I used for the notebook:
* <code>Python 3.7.7</code>
* <code>conda 4.8.5</code>
* <code>Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3</code>
* <code>pandas 1.0.5</code>
* <code>numpy 1.19.1</code>
